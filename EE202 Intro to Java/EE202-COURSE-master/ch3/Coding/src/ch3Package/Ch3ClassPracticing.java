//Intro to Classes, Object, Methods and Strings
//This chapter depends on the terminology and concepts of object-oriented programming
/*
 * Predefined:
 * System.out--object
 * print--method
 * Scanner--class
 */
// in this chapter you will learn how to create your own classes and methods
//each new class you create becomes a new "type" that can be used to declare variables and create objects
package ch3Package;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Ch3ClassPracticing {

	public static void main(String[] args) {//main method is a special method tha's always called auto by the Java Virtual Machine when you execute an App
		//static--is a key part of enabling the JVM to locate and call method main to begin the app's execution 
		//static--i special because you can call it without first creating an object of the class in which the method is declared
		
		/*
		 * Explain the different between next and nextLine methods in Scanner!
		 */
		
//		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
//		System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
//		String name = input.next(); //"next" reads he next word! 
//		System.out.println(name);// the result wiil be the first word any word after the space will not be included
//		
//		String name = input.nextLine(); //Pressing enter inserts a new line character after characters you typed
//		//Scanner provides various other input methods
//		System.out.println(name);
		
		/*PRIMITIVE TYPES VS. REFRENCE TYPES
		 **primitive types: int, boolean, byte, char, short, long, float and double
		 *can hold exactly one value of its declared type at a time. 
		 *recall that local variables are not initialized by default
